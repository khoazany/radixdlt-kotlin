# radixdlt-kotlin
A Kotlin Client library for interacting with a RADIX Distributed Ledger compatible with Kotlin/Java projects and maximising compatibility with all versions of Android.

Compatibility with lower versions of Android is achieved by avoiding the use of any Java 8 APIs e.g. Stream, Optional, Function, etc and using Kotlin built in alternatives.  

For more information on RADIX, please see [https://www.radixdlt.com](https://www.radixdlt.com).

### Code style

This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) via [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) dependency.  
To check code style - `gradle ktlint` (it's also bound to `gradle check`).
